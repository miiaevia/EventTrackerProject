## Event Tracker Project

### Skill Distillery Week 11 Homework

#### Project Description
This program enables a user to enter and track the date, time and amount of their insulin treatments. User may also update treatment information, delete incorrect treatments, view all treatments, and view the average units of insulin per treatment.


#### Technologies used:
* Java
* Git
* Github
* Spring BOOT
* REST
* JPA
* MySql
* AWS/EC2
* Javascript
* HTML

#### Lessons Learned
* The set up and configuration for the project was much harder than the basic CRUD functionality
* It is much more complex to organize and present the information I've retrieved from the REST api than I had anticipated.
* Organize, organize, organize. Hit MVP.
* Next step: go back and refactor for the following:
** code is D.R.Y.
** Display is more organized
* Future phase:
** Add bootstrap
** Add additional business logic
** Use Junit tests to test the additional (and existing) business logic to a greater extent
